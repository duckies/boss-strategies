## Phase 1

### Mechanics

title: World Crusher
subtitle: Pool Soaks
---

On Mythic the boss will attack Azeroth with [World Crusher](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366377) in Phase 1 at the start of the fight, spawning multiple pools of [Blood of Azeroth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366401) and taking Azeroth down to 37% Health.

- **Bloods of Azerite** spawn in multiples and have 3 charges of [Surging Azerite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366408) that are consumed by running into them. The player who touches the blood will chain this effect to any player within 13yds.
- The goal is to form a chain all the way to Azeroth as this will heal her for 5% per charge.
- Players affected by **Surging Azerite** are also given [Azerite Radiation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366703), increasing damage and healing done by 7% per stack up to a maximum of 6 stacks but also making them more vulnerable to **Surging Azerite**.
- Chaining into Azeroth requires a minimum of 5 people per blood. 

The strategy section covers the formation of two groups, a melee and ranged team, that will be chaining the bloods into Azeroth. The "big-dam" strategy is more about hitting 6 stacks and staying there, but requires more careful healing cooldown placement due to the buff's vulnerability component. It's incredibly easy post-nerf to heal Azeroth all the way up and essentially ignore her health for the rest of the fight.

title: Rune of Damnation
subtitle: Bomb Jumping
---
The boss switches between different rune mechanics each phase. In phase 1 the rune mechanic is a bomb applied to 6 players, 3 more than Heroic. A WeakAura will assign players in a triangle pattern indicated on their screen, e.g. `front`, `left`, `right`, ...etc. Another WeakAura will tell you when to jump in the hole.

The orientation of this triangle is always facing Azeroth.

title: Relentless Domination
subtitle: Hide
---
Dominated pylons cast [Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366030/tyranny), marking several players with yellow lines and launching orbs in their direction as seen on Heroic.

On Mythic getting hit by 3 of these lines will mind control the player through [Domination](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362075/domination). A person always gets hit by their own line, so anyone with a line cannot get hit by 2 more.

::callout{type="warning" icon="‚ö†Ô∏è"}
Players with lines should only dodge other lines by running directly at, or directly away from their **own** line. Image shortening or lengthening the line as done on Dausegne. Mind-controls from this should be exceptionally rare and is a dumb death post-nerf.

title: Martyrdom
subtitle: Tank Soak
---
The tank mechanic [Martyrdom](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363893/martyrdom) is a sequence of attacks:

1. [Imprisonment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363886)
2. [Persecution](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363952)
3. [Suffering](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362194)
4. [Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362189)

The raid is concerned with the soaking mechanic, [Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362189/misery). No fewer than 5 players can get hit or we wipe.

On Mythic players hit are given a vulnerability, [Relentless Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362192/relentless-misery), preventing them from soaking the following misery. The strategy will include two alternating soaking groups.

title: Chains of Oppression
subtitle: Gateway

The boss will grip everyone and apply [Chains of Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362631/chains-of-oppression). Players need to run away to decrease the falloff damage from [Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362617/oppression). Gateways will be used throughout the strategy.

This is the spread-out mechanic from Heroic that evolves throughout the fight. Melee should leave the space under the boss clear.
