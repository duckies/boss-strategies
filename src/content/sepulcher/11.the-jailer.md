## WeakAuras

- [RBP — Rune of Damnation Assignments](https://wago.io/o7YY0AkXd/3) — Class-based automatic bomb position assigner.
- [RBP — Beyblade Crosshair](https://wago.io/yXA2QNBA3/1) — Shows crosshairs for character alignment during phase 2 blood soaks.
- [Jailer Bombs & Runes](https://wago.io/Y_GSxwOkm) — A pack of two WeakAuras. The first is a countdown till you can jump into the holes with the bombs; it turns green when you can jump. The second tells you to stack on the boss when you're about to get mind-controlled.
- [SoF - Jailer - Compulsion](https://wago.io/d2WbXHTob) — Nameplate aura that shows how much health is remaining on a mind-controlled player's shield.
- [BGDD Jailer - P3 Torment Assignments (group)](https://wago.io/vTJwnSq41) — Assigns players to a position during P3 torments for stacking adds.

## Phase 1

### Mechanics
::mechanic

link: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366377
title: World Crusher
subtitle: Pool Soaks
---

On Mythic the boss will attack Azeroth with [World Crusher](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366377) in Phase 1 at the start of the fight, spawning multiple pools of [Blood of Azeroth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366401) and taking Azeroth down to 37% Health.

- **Bloods of Azerite** spawn in multiples and have 3 charges of [Surging Azerite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366408) that are consumed by running into them. The player who touches the blood will chain this effect to any player within 13yds.
- The goal is to form a chain all the way to Azeroth as this will heal her for 5% per charge.
- Players affected by **Surging Azerite** are also given [Azerite Radiation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366703), increasing damage and healing done by 7% per stack up to a maximum of 6 stacks but also making them more vulnerable to **Surging Azerite**.
- Chaining into Azeroth requires a minimum of 5 people per blood. 

The strategy section covers the formation of two groups, a melee and ranged team, that will be chaining the bloods into Azeroth. The "big-dam" strategy is more about hitting 6 stacks and staying there, but requires more careful healing cooldown placement due to the buff's vulnerability component. It's incredibly easy post-nerf to heal Azeroth all the way up and essentially ignore her health for the rest of the fight.

title: Rune of Damnation
subtitle: Bomb Jumping
---
The boss switches between different rune mechanics each phase. In phase 1 the rune mechanic is a bomb applied to 6 players, 3 more than Heroic. A WeakAura will assign players in a triangle pattern indicated on their screen, e.g. `front`, `left`, `right`, ...etc. Another WeakAura will tell you when to jump in the hole.

The orientation of this triangle is always facing Azeroth.

title: Relentless Domination
subtitle: Hide
---
Dominated pylons cast [Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366030/tyranny), marking several players with yellow lines and launching orbs in their direction as seen on Heroic.

On Mythic getting hit by 3 of these lines will mind control the player through [Domination](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362075/domination). A person always gets hit by their own line, so anyone with a line cannot get hit by 2 more.

::callout{type="warning" icon="⚠️"}
Players with lines should only dodge other lines by running directly at, or directly away from their **own** line. Image shortening or lengthening the line as done on Dausegne. Mind-controls from this should be exceptionally rare and is a dumb death post-nerf.

title: Martyrdom
subtitle: Tank Soak
---
The tank mechanic [Martyrdom](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363893/martyrdom) is a sequence of attacks:

1. [Imprisonment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363886)
2. [Persecution](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363952)
3. [Suffering](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362194)
4. [Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362189)

The raid is concerned with the soaking mechanic, [Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362189/misery). No fewer than 5 players can get hit or we wipe.

On Mythic players hit are given a vulnerability, [Relentless Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362192/relentless-misery), preventing them from soaking the following misery. The strategy will include two alternating soaking groups.

link: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362631/chains-of-oppression
title: Chains of Oppression
subtitle: Gateway
---

The boss will grip everyone and apply [Chains of Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362631/chains-of-oppression). Players need to run away to decrease the falloff damage from [Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362617/oppression). Gateways will be used throughout the strategy.

subtitle: Spread Out
---
This is the spread-out mechanic from Heroic that evolves throughout the fight. Melee should leave the space under the boss clear.

### Assignments

The tank soaks that we alternate will use 7 people for safety in each soak, one of which is the tank getting the mechanic. 5 of the 6 people not assigned to any group will be in charge of the ranged blood soak. It can be quite difficult for the ranged blood people to get back to the boss in time, so they aren't in the rotation.

```
#soak Tank1 Melee1 Melee2 Melee3 Melee4 Melee5 Melee6
#soak Tank2 Ranged1 Ranged2 Ranged3 Ranged4 Ranged5 Ranged6
```

They are generally called the melee and ranged groups, but role doesn't impact the mechanic.

The bloods should be activated **2 seconds after the timer** calls to soak them. This gives us the time to refresh the DoT next time instead of it resetting.

## Phase 2

### Mechanics

::mechanic
---
link: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366776/world-cracker
title: World Cracker
subtitle: Soak Pools
---

The boss attacks Azeroth and spawns blood as he did with [World Crusher](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366377) in phase 1.

However, players who help soak these pools eject [Tainted Azerite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366782/tainted-azerite) in the the cardinal directions with North being where the player is facing. It does a moderate amount of splash damage if hit. This is fundamentally the same as the Painsmith chains mechanic.

Players who are in the 2 soaking groups of 4 players will stagger themselves diagonally from the pool to Azeroth. They will then physically turn their character to line up the WeakAura lines so that they intersect with the person directly opposite you on the other soaking group.

link: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=360373/unholy-attunement
title: Unholy Attunement
subtitle: Break Pillars
---

[Unholy Attunement](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=360373/unholy-attunement) is the mechanic the Jailer uses to bring pillars out of the ground. Just as on Heroic, tanks will use [Shattering Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=359868/shattering-blast) to destroy these pillars. 

The Jailer will summon pillars in sets of 3 around the room. The moment a pillar is 3 long it will reach Azeroth and end the phase. The tanks can only clear two per set so eventually we will phase due to this mechanic, but if the tanks miss a pylon you are likely to phase 1 set early.

If a pillar touches a blood the boss gains [Consumed Azerite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366777/consumed-azerite) as a large absorb shield. This forces us to soak the bloods.

title: Rune of Compulsion
subtitle: Break MCs
---
Phase 2's version of the rune mechanic mind-controls 3 players after a 4 second delay. One of the recommended WeakAuras will tell you to get under the boss. If [Torment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362415/torment) is happening at the same time these players should still stack under the boss, as they will become mind-controlled just before these go off.

Stuns and priority targeting should be used to clear them quickly. Avoid long-winded slows and bleeds.

::callout{type="info" icon="🧠"}
Shamans can use Tremor Totem just before getting mind-controlled to dispel themselves of the effect.

::mechanic
---
link: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=360562/decimator
title: Decimator
subtitle: Avoid
---
The boss will periodically cast Decimator, a large blue swirly seen on Heroic. The swl and the thin blue line directly in front of the boss connected to the swirly are lethal. This no longer knocks back.
::

::mechanic
---
link: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362415/torment
title: Torment
subtitle: Spread
---

[Torment] evolves in phase 2 to leave behind a swirl that explodes 4 seconds after the initial torment hit goes off. This turns the mechanic into [Earthbreaker Missiles](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=361676/earthbreaker-missiles). Melee should leave a free space under the boss.
