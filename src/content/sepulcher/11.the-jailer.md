## WeakAuras

::callout{type="warning" icon="⚠️"}
I have not looked at WeakAuras in earnest yet, do not take these as gospel. Prefer what Thaerhum has linked in `#strategies` for now.
::

- [Rune of Damnation Assignments [Levels Version]](https://wago.io/-Pk-iHqg0) — Class-based automatic bomb position assigner.
- [Jailer Bombs & Runes](https://wago.io/Y_GSxwOkm) — A pack of two WeakAuras. The first is a countdown till you can jump into the holes with the bombs; it turns green when you can jump. The second tells you to stack on the boss when you're about to get mind-controlled.
- [SoF - Jailer - Compulsion](https://wago.io/d2WbXHTob) — Nameplate aura that shows how much health is remaining on a mind-controlled player's shield.
- [Jailer - Cross](https://wago.io/BqS_fZxO9) — Covers your screen in cardinal lines to line up with other players for blood soaks.
- [BGDD Jailer - P3 Torment Assignments (group)](https://wago.io/vTJwnSq41) — Assigns players to a position during P3 torments for stacking adds.
## Phase 1

### Mechanics

title: World Crusher
subtitle: Pool Soaks
---

On Mythic the boss will attack Azeroth with [World Crusher](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366377) in Phase 1 at the start of the fight, spawning multiple pools of [Blood of Azeroth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366401) and taking Azeroth down to 37% Health.

- **Bloods of Azerite** spawn in multiples and have 3 charges of [Surging Azerite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366408) that are consumed by running into them. The player who touches the blood will chain this effect to any player within 13yds.
- The goal is to form a chain all the way to Azeroth as this will heal her for 5% per charge.
- Players affected by **Surging Azerite** are also given [Azerite Radiation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366703), increasing damage and healing done by 7% per stack up to a maximum of 6 stacks but also making them more vulnerable to **Surging Azerite**.
- Chaining into Azeroth requires a minimum of 5 people per blood. 

The strategy section covers the formation of two groups, a melee and ranged team, that will be chaining the bloods into Azeroth. The "big-dam" strategy is more about hitting 6 stacks and staying there, but requires more careful healing cooldown placement due to the buff's vulnerability component. It's incredibly easy post-nerf to heal Azeroth all the way up and essentially ignore her health for the rest of the fight.

title: Rune of Damnation
subtitle: Bomb Jumping
---
The boss switches between different rune mechanics each phase. In phase 1 the rune mechanic is a bomb applied to 6 players, 3 more than Heroic. A WeakAura will assign players in a triangle pattern indicated on their screen, e.g. `front`, `left`, `right`, ...etc. Another WeakAura will tell you when to jump in the hole.

The orientation of this triangle is always facing Azeroth.

  We start on the labeled triangle and move clockwise throughout the phase.

title: Relentless Domination
subtitle: Hide
---
Dominated pylons cast [Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366030/tyranny), marking several players with yellow lines and launching orbs in their direction as seen on Heroic.

On Mythic getting hit by 3 of these lines will mind control the player through [Domination](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362075/domination). A person always gets hit by their own line, so anyone with a line cannot get hit by 2 more.

::callout{type="warning" icon="⚠️"}
Players with lines should only dodge other lines by running directly at, or directly away from their **own** line. Image shortening or lengthening the line as done on Dausegne. Mind-controls from this should be exceptionally rare and is a dumb death post-nerf.

title: Martyrdom
subtitle: Tank Soak
---
The tank mechanic [Martyrdom](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363893/martyrdom) is a sequence of attacks:

1. [Imprisonment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363886)
2. [Persecution](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363952)
3. [Suffering](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362194)
4. [Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362189)

The raid is concerned with the soaking mechanic, [Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362189/misery). No fewer than 5 players can get hit or we wipe.

On Mythic players hit are given a vulnerability, [Relentless Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362192/relentless-misery), preventing them from soaking the following misery. The strategy will include two alternating soaking groups.

title: Chains of Oppression
subtitle: Gateway
---

The boss will grip everyone and apply [Chains of Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362631/chains-of-oppression). Players need to run away to decrease the falloff damage from [Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362617/oppression). Gateways will be used throughout the strategy.

subtitle: Spread Out

This is the spread-out mechanic from Heroic that evolves throughout the fight. Melee should leave the space under the boss clear.

### Assignments

The tank soaks that we alternate will use 7 people for safety in each soak, one of which is the tank getting the mechanic. 5 of the 6 people not assigned to any group will be in charge of the ranged blood soak. It can be quite difficult for the ranged blood people to get back to the boss in time, so they aren't in the rotation.

```
#soak Tank1 Melee1 Melee2 Melee3 Melee4 Melee5 Melee6
#soak Tank2 Ranged1 Ranged2 Ranged3 Ranged4 Ranged5 Ranged6
```

They are generally called the melee and ranged groups, but role doesn't impact the mechanic.

### Strategy

We pull the boss to the triangle for the 6th bombs go, close to where he starts.

1. `0:15` — Spread for [Torment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362415/torment).
2. `0:18` — Gateway out of [Chains of Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362631/chains-of-oppression). This puts us on triangle for the 1st set of bombs.

![P1 First Sequence](/images/raids/sepulcher/jailer/jailer-p1-1.png)

3. `0:25` — `Blood Soak 1`. Chain one blood puddle through the entire raid and into Azeroth. We will get 3 stacks. Ranged will be the ones that connect the blood to melee, and melee to Azeroth.
4. `0:30` — `Tank Soak 1 (G1)`. First tank soak group.

![P1 Second Sequence](/images/raids/sepulcher/jailer/jailer-p1-2.png)

5. `0:35` — `Bombs 1`. This is immediately followed by [Relentless Domination](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362028), requiring us to LoS behind the pillars. The tanks will move the boss to diamond immediately after.
6. `0:50` — `Torment 2`. Spread.
7. `0:58` — `Bombs 2` 

![P1 Third Sequence](/images/raids/sepulcher/jailer/jailer-p1-3.png)

8. `1:10` — `Blood Soak 2 + 3`. This is the first soak with the 5 dedicated ranged soaking group doing a far pool. The ranged that are not part that 5 will start and finish the melee's chain. At this point the previous [Azerite Radiation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366703) has fallen off, so we go from `0 -> 3` stack wise.
9. `1:20` — `Tank Soak 2 (G2)`

::callout{type="warning" icon="⚠️"}
The bloods should be activated **2 seconds after the timer** calls to soak them. This gives us the time to refresh the DoT next time instead of it resetting.
::

![P1 Fourth Sequence](/images/raids/sepulcher/jailer/jailer-p1-4.png)

10. `1:25` — `Bomb Set 3`
11. `1:30` — `Torment 3`
12. `1:45` — `Blood Soaks 4 + 5`. This is the hardest part of P1 and the component of the "big dam" strat. Instead of the debuff falling off again we will soak the bloods on the timer exactly and go up to 6 stacks. The vulnerability makes us take a lot of damage, demanding many healing cooldowns and personals.
13. `1:48` — `Tank Soak 3 (G1)`

![P1 Fifth Sequence](/images/raids/sepulcher/jailer/jailer-p1-5.png)

14. `1:55` — Boss moves after tank soak.
15. `2:00` — `Bombs 4`
16. `2:05` — `Torment 4`
17. `2:07` — `Chains of Oppression 2`. We gateway to the next "triangle" area.

![P1 Sixth Sequence](/images/raids/sepulcher/jailer/jailer-p1-6.png)

18. `2:07` — Boss is moved to `moon`.
19. `2:18` — `Blood Soak 4`. This is chained through the entire raid.
20. `2:20` — `Bombs 5`

![P1 Seventh Sequence](/images/raids/sepulcher/jailer/jailer-p1-7.png)

21. `2:34` — `Tank Soak 4 (G2)` then the boss is moved to `star`.
22. `2:40` — `Bomb Set 6`
23. `2:50` — `Torment 5`

![P1 Eighth Sequence](/images/raids/sepulcher/jailer/jailer-p1-8.png)
