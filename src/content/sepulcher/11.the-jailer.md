## WeakAuras

- [`Rune of Damnation Assignments [Levels Version]`](https://wago.io/-Pk-iHqg0) — Class-based automatic bomb position assigner.
- [`Jailer Bombs & Runes`](https://wago.io/Y_GSxwOkm) — A pack of two WeakAuras. The first is a countdown till you can jump into the holes with the bombs; it turns green when you can jump. The second tells you to stack on the boss when you're about to get mind-controlled.
- [`SoF - Jailer - Compulsion`](https://wago.io/d2WbXHTob) — Nameplate aura that shows how much health is remaining on a mind-controlled player's shield.
- [`Jailer - Cross`](https://wago.io/BqS_fZxO9) — Covers your screen in cardinal lines to line up with other players for blood soaks.
- [`BGDD Jailer - P3 Torment Assignments (group)`](https://wago.io/vTJwnSq41) — Assigns players to a position during P3 torments for stacking adds.

title: World Crusher
subtitle: Chain Blood Links

In Mythic, the boss will attack Azeroth with [World Crusher](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366377) in Phase 1 at the start of the fight, spawning multiple pools of [Blood of Azeroth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366401) and taking Azeroth down to 37% Health.

These pools need to be soaked in order to heal Azeroth, by standing in a line between the pools and Azeroth. The positioning of this will be explained in detail in the strategy section of the guide.

When soaking a pool, the player who soaks will cause [Surging Azerite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366408) to shoot out of them, latching onto the closest player within 13yd. This will then bounce to the next player and so on so forth. You use this mechanic to chain a line all the way to Azeroth so that the Blood heals her.

When soaking the Blood of Azeroth, players will receive a stack of [Azerite Radiation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366703) for each tick of Surging Azerite that goes through them. The damage they take from Surging Azerite increases with each stack, as does their damage and healing done (3% per stack).

You will need to make 2 teams for this in Phase 1:
- **Melee Team**: Stands with the boss and chains Blood into Azeroth.
- **Ranged Team**: Plays off to the left hand side and chains blood into Azeroth away from the boss (we use 5 players for this).

Dominated pylons cast [Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366030/tyranny), marking several players with yellow lines and launching orbs in their direction as seen on Heroic.

On Mythic getting hit by 3 of these lines will mind control the player through [Domination](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362075/domination). A person always gets hit by their own line, so anyone with a line cannot get hit by 2 more.

subtitle: Tank Combo & Soak

The tank mechanic [Martyrdom](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363893/martyrdom) is a sequence of attacks:

1. [Imprisonment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363886)
2. [Persecution](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363952)
3. [Suffering](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362194)
4. [Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362189)

The raid is concerned with the soaking mechanic, [Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362189/misery). No fewer than 5 players can get hit or we wipe.

On Mythic players hit are given a vulnerability, [Relentless Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362192/relentless-misery), preventing them from soaking the following misery.

The boss will grip everyone and apply [Chains of Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362631/chains-of-oppression). Players need to run away to decrease the falloff damage from [Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362617/oppression).
