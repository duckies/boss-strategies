## WeakAuras

- [RBP — Rune of Damnation](https://wago.io/o7YY0AkXd) — Class-based automatic bomb position assigner.
- [RBP — Beyblade Crosshair](https://wago.io/yXA2QNBA3/1) — Shows crosshairs for character alignment during phase 2 blood soaks.
- [Jailer Bombs & Runes](https://wago.io/Y_GSxwOkm) — A pack of two WeakAuras. The first is a countdown till you can jump into the holes with the bombs; it turns green when you can jump. The second tells you to stack on the boss when you're about to get mind-controlled.
- [SoF - Jailer - Compulsion](https://wago.io/d2WbXHTob) — Nameplate aura that shows how much health is remaining on a mind-controlled player's shield.
- [BGDD Jailer - P3 Torment Assignments (group)](https://wago.io/vTJwnSq41) — Assigns players to a position during P3 torments for stacking adds.

## Phase 1

### Mechanics
::mechanic
---
link: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366377
title: World Crusher
subtitle: Pool Soaks
unique: world-p1
---

On Mythic the boss will attack Azeroth with [World Crusher](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366377) in Phase 1 at the start of the fight, spawning multiple pools of [Blood of Azeroth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366401) and taking Azeroth down to 37% Health.

- **Bloods of Azerite** spawn in multiples and have 3 charges of [Surging Azerite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366408) that are consumed by running into them. The player who touches the blood will chain this effect to any player within 13yds.
- The goal is to form a chain all the way to Azeroth as this will heal her for 5% per charge.
- Players affected by **Surging Azerite** are also given [Azerite Radiation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366703), increasing damage and healing done by 7% per stack up to a maximum of 6 stacks but also making them more vulnerable to **Surging Azerite**.
- Chaining into Azeroth requires a minimum of 5 people per blood. 

The strategy section covers the formation of two groups, a melee and ranged team, that will be chaining the bloods into Azeroth. The "big-dam" strategy is more about hitting 6 stacks and staying there, but requires more careful healing cooldown placement due to the buff's vulnerability component. It's incredibly easy post-nerf to heal Azeroth all the way up and essentially ignore her health for the rest of the fight.

subtitle: Bomb Jumping
unique: bomb-p1

The boss switches between different rune mechanics each phase. In phase 1 the rune mechanic is a bomb applied to 6 players, 3 more than Heroic. A WeakAura will assign players in a triangle pattern indicated on their screen, e.g. `front`, `left`, `right`, ...etc. Another WeakAura will tell you when to jump in the hole.

The orientation of this triangle is always facing Azeroth.

Dominated pylons cast [Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366030/tyranny), marking several players with yellow lines and launching orbs in their direction as seen on Heroic.

On Mythic getting hit by 3 of these lines will mind control the player through [Domination](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362075/domination). A person always gets hit by their own line, so anyone with a line cannot get hit by 2 more.

::callout{type="warning" icon="⚠️"}
Players with lines should only dodge other lines by running directly at, or directly away from their **own** line. Image shortening or lengthening the line as done on Dausegne. Mind-controls from this should be exceptionally rare and is a dumb death post-nerf.

subtitle: Tank Soak
unique: marty-p1

The tank mechanic [Martyrdom](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363893/martyrdom) is a sequence of attacks:

1. [Imprisonment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363886)
2. [Persecution](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363952)
3. [Suffering](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362194)
4. [Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362189)

The raid is concerned with the soaking mechanic, [Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362189/misery). No fewer than 5 players can get hit or we wipe.

On Mythic players hit are given a vulnerability, [Relentless Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362192/relentless-misery), preventing them from soaking the following misery. The strategy will include two alternating soaking groups.

unique: chains-p1

The boss will grip everyone and apply [Chains of Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362631/chains-of-oppression). Players need to run away to decrease the falloff damage from [Oppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362617/oppression). Gateways will be used throughout the strategy.

This is the spread-out mechanic from Heroic that evolves throughout the fight. Melee should leave the space under the boss clear.
::

### Assignments

The tank soaks that we alternate will use 7 people for safety in each soak, one of which is the tank getting the mechanic. 5 of the 6 people not assigned to any group will be in charge of the ranged blood soak. It can be quite difficult for the ranged blood people to get back to the boss in time, so they aren't in the rotation.

### Strategy

The first phase has the boss rotating around the platform for each bomb set and assigned positions for blood soaking and chaining.

## Phase 2

### Mechanics

::mechanic
---
link: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366776/world-cracker
title: World Cracker
subtitle: Soak Pools
unique: world-p2
---

The boss attacks Azeroth and spawns blood as he did with [World Crusher](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366377) in phase 1.

However, players who help soak these pools eject [Tainted Azerite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366782/tainted-azerite) in the the cardinal directions with North being where the player is facing. It does a moderate amount of splash damage if hit. This is fundamentally the same as the Painsmith chains mechanic.

Players who are in the 2 soaking groups of 4 players will stagger themselves diagonally from the pool to Azeroth. They will then physically turn their character to line up the WeakAura lines so that they intersect with the person directly opposite you on the other soaking group.

title: Unholy Attunement
subtitle: Break Pillars
unique: unholy-p2
---

[Unholy Attunement](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=360373/unholy-attunement) is the mechanic the Jailer uses to bring pillars out of the ground. Just as on Heroic, tanks will use [Shattering Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=359868/shattering-blast) to destroy these pillars. 

The Jailer will summon pillars in sets of 3 around the room. The moment a pillar is 3 long it will reach Azeroth and end the phase. The tanks can only clear two per set so eventually we will phase due to this mechanic, but if the tanks miss a pylon you are likely to phase 1 set early.

If a pillar touches a blood the boss gains [Consumed Azerite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366777/consumed-azerite) as a large absorb shield. This forces us to soak the bloods.

title: Rune of Compulsion
subtitle: Break MCs
unique: rune-p2
---
Phase 2's version of the rune mechanic mind-controls 3 players after a 4 second delay. One of the recommended WeakAuras will tell you to get under the boss. If [Torment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362415/torment) is happening at the same time these players should still stack under the boss, as they will become mind-controlled just before these go off.

Stuns and priority targeting should be used to clear them quickly. Avoid long-winded slows and bleeds.

::callout{type="info" icon="🧠"}
Shamans can use Tremor Totem just before getting mind-controlled to dispel themselves of the effect.

[Torment] evolves in phase 2 to leave behind a swirl that explodes 4 seconds after the initial torment hit goes off. This turns the mechanic into [Earthbreaker Missiles](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=361676/earthbreaker-missiles). Melee should leave a free space under the boss.

Just as with [World Cracker](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366776/world-cracker) in phase 2 and [World Crusher](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=366377/world-crusher) in phase 1, the Jailer slaps Azeroth at the start of phase 3 and spawns bloods.

Given the recent nerfs it is unnecessary to heal Azeroth any further. It is actually detrimental to do so, as [Expelled Corruption](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370025/expelled-corruption) arrows shoot out of Azeroth whenever she is healed. They hurt a lot and silence but are effectively no longer a mechanic.

As with Heroic the boss will face Azeroth and a column will eminate from him towards her. At least 17 people need to stand in this column to soak the effect to prevent Azeroth from taking too much damage and dying.

The rune mechanic of phase 3 is [Rune of Domination](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=365151/rune-of-domination). Three people are given a debuff that expires after 8 seconds, dealing 45k damage to those in its radius and applying [Dominating Will](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=365153/dominating-will) as an absorb shield split evenly with those who help soak with them.

This mechanic should no longer be seen as we'll push to 15% and forcing the Jailer to enter phase 4 before this occurs. It happens about 10 seconds after the second [Defile](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=365174/defile).

Seen on Heroic, [Chains of Anguish](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=365219/chains-of-anguish) go on the 3 players nearest the active tank, slowing these players and dealing damage.

When they go out the active tank will instantly snap all of the chains. Personals and healing cooldowns are necessary to deal with the bursts of damage from [Chain Breaker](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=365224).

In the third phase [Torment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362415/torment) only goes on 10 non-tank players and spawns the Incarnation of Torment adds that continously try to cast [Cry of Loathing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=365385/cry-of-loathing) so long as they live. Since they cannot be gripped on Mythic we will utilize the [BGDD Jailer - P3 Torment Assignments (group)](https://wago.io/vTJwnSq41) WeakAura to stack 2 debuffs on top of each other at a time in close proximity for easy add cleave.

The torment occurs immediately following the first [Defile](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=365174/defile), meaning we will be stacked together coming out of a gateway. So facing Azeroth, each player will orient themselves on their assigned corner of the pentagram.

[Defile](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=365174/defile) still targets only ranged as seen on Heroic. On Mythic, the defile pools slowly grow in size, requiring us to make dramatic movements away from them.

The strategy intends for us to only see one defile, but getting a second one is possible with damage issues. The first one we will gateway away from and hopefully not get the next one.

---
The active tank will be targeted by a conical soaking mechanic that needs to be soaked by everyone not getting rid of a bomb or is afflicted with [Death Sentence](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363748/death-sentence). This will do a considerable knockback.
::

::mechanic
---
link: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363748/death-sentence

subtitle: Dispel & Catch
unique: death-sentence-p4
---
In phase 4 a player will be debuffed with [Death Sentence](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363748/death-sentence). It does moderate damage that increases in intensity over time.

The mechanic is dispellable, and players with things like [Diffuse Magic](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=122783/diffuse-magic) need to be careful. When the debuff expires or is dispelled 2 more of the debuffs will spawn soakable puddles nearby. Soaking the puddles gives *anyone* who stands in the soak the debuff, but failing to soak a puddle will put [Death Sentence](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=363748/death-sentence) on the entire raid. Furthermore, getting 2 stacks of this debuff is lethal.

Our strategy of spending as little time as possible in phase 3 and 4 means we shouldn't have to deal with this mechanic in its entirety. If a player is at risk of dying with it we can dispel them and have the tanks, or any other random players, soak the mechanic, and the boss should die before we have to do so again. It's important not to double-up on soaking puddles, but not soaking a puddle could wipe the raid as it will kill anyone already with the debuff (since 2 stacks is lethal).
