## Mechanics

### Collapsing Quasars and Dark Eclipse

The dance of killing quasars and clearing dark eclipse bombs with the fields left by their sparkly corpses is fundamental and unchanged.

Quasars still spawn at corners of the hexagon ingrained on the platform and sashay towards the boss, wiping the raid if any of them touch him. They can be slowed and knocked, but gradually gain immunity to slows and pick up speed. Dark eclipse is applied to 3 players on Mythic instead of 2 on Heroic, though most videos are pre-nerf and will likely show 4 but that doesnâ€™t change anything.

The difficulty of the fight is killing the quasars at the opportune time. 2 sets of quasars will spawn per upstairs phase, but 3 sets of dark eclipse debuffs go out and the fields left by quasars do not last long enough to make it to the next round of dark eclipse. This requires us to partition quasars so that we save some for the next round of dark eclipse. This is all covered in the strategy section.

Tanks and healers cannot get dark eclipse, and dark eclipse makes you ineligible to get it in the next set. I do believe this ineligibility resets at the start of each upstairs phase. Furthermore, it will target at least 1 melee and 1 ranged per set.

Coming into contact with the [Collapsing Quasar Field](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=361462) spawned by the death of a quasar applies [Event Horizon](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=362206) to the player. The fields do not care if you have dark eclipse or not, making it possible for other players (especially melee) to accidentally steal them.

Event horizon manifests as a circle around the player and the room changing color as they temporarily enter the downstairs phase. After 9 seconds event horizon falls off, dealing 45k damage to allies within the circle and knocking them away. On top of avoiding other players when the debuff expries, these players have to deal with **Unstable Quasar** and **Unstable Matter**.
